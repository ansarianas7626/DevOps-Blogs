## Login into a Virtual Machine

Make sure you have AWS account if you don’t have account you can refer to this blog [https://anas23.hashnode.dev/how-to-create-virtual-machine-aws-and-azure](https://anas23.hashnode.dev/how-to-create-virtual-machine-aws-and-azure)

There are multiple ways to login into a VM:

* **Browser-based Login (UI)** → AWS provides **EC2 Instance Connect**, where you can directly open a terminal in your browser.
    
* **SSH from Terminal** → Secure Shell (SSH) is the most common way to login into a Linux VM. You’ll need a private key (`.pem` file) and the instance’s public IP address.
    
* **Infrastructure as Code tools** like **CloudFormation/CDK** → Here you don’t manually login, but rather automate the creation and configuration of the VM.
    
* **SDKs (like Python Boto3)** → You can even login or interact programmatically with your VM using AWS EC2 API.
    
    ## **1\. Browser-based Login (UI)**
    
    1. Create an AWS instance as per the requirement.
        
    2. Go to instances section in AWS Console click on instances ID and click on connect.
        
    3. New page appear again click on connect it will take a while and you are connected with AWS EC2 instance with AWS own UI terminal
        
    
    **Note:** People prefer to use their own terminal like I term for mac and Mobaxterm and Nomachine terminal you can use your own because AWS UI terminal is not so efficient.
    
    ## 2\. SSH from Terminal
    
    ## Manual way
    
    1. You can use terminal of your choice. In this process MobaXterm is used which is for window user.
        
    2. Download and install mobaXterm on your windows machine from mobaXterm official website and install it just like any other software.
        
    3. Once installed open it and click on session to and choose SSH for session.
        
    4. Copy IPV4 address of your AWS EC2 Instance from AWS UI console and paste in Remote host option click on specify username and name it like ubuntu mac etc. whatever instance you have created.
        
    5. Now click on Advance SSH setting click on use private key and provide .pem file which you have got while creating AWS EC2 instance from AWS Console in key value pair section.Finally click on ok it will authenticate with AWS EC2 instance run first command as sudo apt update to update package list.
        
    6. To test you can run command like touch &lt;Filename here&gt; and type ls if folder appears means you have successfully connected.
        
    
    * ## Automated way
        
    
    1. Up till now we have created AWS EC2 instance through Console but we this time we will create it using AWS CLI. With AWS CLI we can create S3 Bucket or EC2 instance and bunch of other services
        
    2. First download and install AWS CLI package from AWS official documentation as per you OS Linux, Windows or mac.
        
    3. Verify if it is installed properly or not simply using command aws version through CMD or Windows PowerShell or mobaXterm Shell, If list appears it means it is installed successfully.
        
    4. Remember that AWS CLI is not a terminal it is binary or package of AWS to support AWS stuff on your computer. as AWS CLI is a binary it does not have user information or account information so firstly you have to authenticate it with AWS account
        
    5. Go to AWS Console go to profile click on security credentials create Access Key. Do not Share you access key and secret access key.
        
    6. Copy both secret key access key.
        
    7. Now go back to terminal (MobaXterm or any) write command like aws configure it will ask for access and secret access key provide it and choose other options as default like region and output format if both showing none run there command one by one **aws configure set region ap-south-1** and **aws configure set output json**. Now you are authenticated with AWS
        
    8. All the command are given now reflect on AWS like ls, aws s3 bucket - will show all buckets we can also create bucket refer this documentation for more commands [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-services-ec2-instances.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-services-ec2-instances.html)
        
    
    ## **3\. Infrastructure as Code tools** like **CloudFormation/CDK**
    
    it is another way of talking with your AWS
    
    Refer this github repository for the CDK template [https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/tree/main](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/tree/main)
    
    ### Step 1
    
    1. Go to AWS Console Click on Cloud Formation →CloudFormation → Create Stack → With new resources (standard)
        
    2. Upload your template YAML File
        
    3. Give Stack name (e.g., `MyEC2Stack`)
        
    4. fill Parameters (if template has variable)
        
    5. Click on create stack
        
        CloudFormation will automatically launch our EC2 instance
        
    
    ### Step 2: Create Stack
    
    1. Go to AWS Console Click on Cloud Formation →CloudFormation → Create Stack → With new resources (standard)
        
    2. Upload your template YAML File
        
    3. Give Stack name (e.g., `MyEC2Stack`)
        
    4. fill Parameters (if template has variable)
        
    5. Click on create stack
        
        CloudFormation will automatically launch our EC2 instance
        
    
    ### Step 3: Check EC2 Instance details
    
    1. After completing CloudFormation stack
        
    2. Go to **Resources tab** and note down **Instance ID**
        
    3. Go to EC2 Console and note down Public IP or Public DNS
        
    4. **Resources tab** me jaake EC2 instance ka **Instance ID** note karo
        
    5. EC2 console me jaake public IP ya public DNS note karo
        
    
    ### Step 4: Access the EC2 via SSH
    
    1. Open terminal (MobaXterm or any) and run command
        
    2. ssh -i /path/to/my-key-pair.pem ubuntu@&lt;EC2 Public IP&gt;
        
        * `/path/to/my-key-pair.pem` = wo key jo aapne `KeyName` me diya
            
        * `<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>` = public IP of instance
            
        * Username - for Ubuntu `ubuntu`, for Amazon Linux `ec2-user`
            
    
    ### Step 5: Cleanup
    
    After testing, delete the CloudFormation stack to avoid charges:
    
    * Go to **CloudFormation → select stack → Delete stack**
        
    * This will automatically terminate the EC2 instance created by the stack.
        
    
    Note: This cleanup process for those who are learning cloud formation not for production practices. if done in production EC2 services will go down as EC2 is deleted or stopped.
    
    ## **4\. SDKs (like Python Boto3)**
    
    1. Create a Python script make sure python is installed in your system
        
    
    ```plaintext
    import boto3
    
    ec2 = boto3.resource(
        'ec2',
        aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
        aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
        region_name='ap-south-1'
    )
    ```
    
    ### EC2 Instance Access Examples
    
    ### A. List all running EC2 instances
    
    ```plaintext
    import boto3
    
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')
    
    for instance in ec2.instances.all():
        print(f'Instance ID: {instance.id}, State: {instance.state["Name"]}, Public IP: {instance.public_ip_address}')
    ```
    
    ### B. Start an EC2 instance
    
    ```plaintext
    instance_id = 'i-0123456789abcdef0'  # Replace with your instance ID
    
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')
    ec2_client.start_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    print(f'Starting instance {instance_id}')
    ```
    
    ### C. Stop an EC2 instance
    
    ```plaintext
    instance_id = 'i-0123456789abcdef0'
    
    ec2_client = boto3.client('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')
    ec2_client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=[instance_id])
    print(f'Stopping instance {instance_id}')
    ```
    
    ### D. Connect via SSH (Programmatically using paramiko)
    
    “Boto3 itself does not provide direct SSH login, but you can fetch the public IP and use the Paramiko library to SSH into the instance.”
    
    ```plaintext
    pip install paramiko
    ```
    
    ```plaintext
    import boto3
    import paramiko
    
    # Fetch instance details
    ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2', region_name='ap-south-1')
    instance = ec2.Instance('i-0123456789abcdef0')
    
    key = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file('mykey.pem')
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    ssh.connect(hostname=instance.public_ip_address, username='ec2-user', pkey=key)
    
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('ls -la')
    print(stdout.read().decode())
    
    ssh.close()
    ```
