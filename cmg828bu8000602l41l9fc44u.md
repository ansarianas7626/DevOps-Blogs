## What is Operating System(OS)?

An **Operating System (OS)** acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**.

üëâ **Example:** Suppose you want to run a program like Python, Java, a video, or a game on your computer. You cannot directly interact with hardware (CPU, RAM, disk). You need a **medium**, and that medium is the OS. The OS provides a **user interface (UI)** and allows software to communicate with hardware.

Popular Operating Systems: **Windows, macOS, Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.)**

## What is Linux ? üêß

**Linux** is an free and open-source Operating System kernel created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

there are many distributions based on Linux like Ubuntu, Cent OS, Red hat OS the all are built on top of Linux.

## Why is Linux used in server?

Linux is the **most popular choice for servers** because:

* ‚úÖ Free and Open Source
    
* ‚úÖ More Secure than Windows
    
* ‚úÖ Lightweight and Fast
    
* ‚úÖ Highly Reliable & Scalable
    

That‚Äôs why the majority of **web servers, cloud servers, and enterprise applications** run on Linux.

## What is the Linux Kernel?

The **Kernel** is the **heart of Linux OS**.  
It manages communication between **hardware** (CPU, RAM, Devices) and **software** (applications, user processes).

When you install Linux, you are basically installing:

* Kernel
    
* System libraries
    
* Compilers
    
* User processes
    
* System utilities
    

### Major Responsibilities of Kernel:

1. **Device Management** ‚Äì handles device communication (keyboard, disk, etc.)
    
2. **Memory Management** ‚Äì allocates and frees memory for processes
    
3. **Process Management** ‚Äì manages running programs and multitasking
    
4. **System Calls Handling** ‚Äì provides an interface between software and hardware
    

## What are Linux Distributions?

**Linux Distributions (Distros)** are different versions of Linux packaged by vendors with additional tools.

Examples:

* **Ubuntu** ‚Äì beginner-friendly, widely used
    
* **CentOS** ‚Äì popular for servers
    
* **Debian** ‚Äì stable and secure
    
* **Fedora** ‚Äì cutting-edge features
    
* **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)** ‚Äì enterprise-grade
    

## What is Shell Scripting ? üìú

In Linux, we often interact using **Command Line Interface (CLI)** instead of GUI.  
**Shell Scripting** allows us to write commands in a script file to automate tasks.

üëâ Example:

* In **Windows**, you create a folder using GUI (right click ‚Üí new folder).
    
* In **Linux**, you do it with a command:
    
    ```plaintext
    mkdir myFolder
    ```
    

Shell scripting is very powerful for automation, system monitoring, backups, and server administration.

## Basic Linux Commands üñ±Ô∏èüíª

Here are some important beginner-friendly Linux commands:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ls` | Shows list of files and folders |
| `pwd` | Shows present working directory |
| `cd` | Change directory |
| `cd ..` | Move one level back |
| `cd ../..` | Move two levels back |
| `cd ~` | Go to home directory |
| `mkdir folderName` | Create a new directory |
| `touch fileName` | Create a file (e.g. `touch index.html`) |
| `ls -ltr` | Detailed list (timestamp, owner, permissions, size) |
| `rm fileName` | Delete a file |
| `rm -r folderName` | Delete a directory |
| `vi fileName` | Create/Edit a file with `vi` editor |
| `cat fileName` | Display file content |

üëâ Note: Always run `pwd` after login to confirm your location in the file system.

## Performance Monitoring in Linux üìä

Monitoring system resources is very important for server health. If you want to monitor the utilization of your RAM, CPU and Storage of your machine which is very important there are few Linux command for it.

| Command | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| `free` | Check RAM utilization |
| `nproc` | Show number of CPU cores |
| `df` | Check disk usage |
| `top` | Live monitoring of CPU, RAM, processes |

## Real-Life Usage of Linux

* Cloud servers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
    
* Web hosting
    
* Cybersecurity & Hacking tools
    
* IoT devices
    
* Supercomputers
    

## **Short Forms and Abbreviations** üìù

| Abbreviation | Full Form |
| --- | --- |
| OS | Operating System |
| CLI | Command Line Interface |
| GUI | Graphical User Interface |
| CPU | Central Processing Unit |
| RAM | Random Access Memory |
| HDD | Hard Disk Drive |
| SSD | Solid State Drive |
| RHEL | Red Hat Enterprise Linux |
| vi | Visual Editor |
| mkdir | Make Directory |
| pwd | Present Working Directory |
| ls | List |
| rm | Remove |
| nproc | Number of Processors |
| df | Disk Free |
| top | Table Of Processes |

## Conclusion ‚úÖ

In this blog, we learned the **basics of Operating Systems and Linux**:

* The **OS** acts as a bridge between **hardware and software**.
    
* **Linux** is a **fast, secure, and open-source OS** widely used in servers.
    
* The **Kernel** is the core of Linux that manages hardware and software communication.
    
* There are multiple **Linux distributions (distros)** like Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and RHEL.
    
* **Shell scripting and CLI commands** allow efficient interaction and automation in Linux.
