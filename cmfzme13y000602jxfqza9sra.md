So in today‚Äôs fast pace world tech companies and startup want to deliver their application/software in quick manner this is where DevOps comes into picture.

DevOps is nothing but a culture or process of improving the application delivery by ensuring that there is a proper automation, quality, monitoring/observability and continuous testing.

Example: let say delivering software manually takes 10 days with manual approach this is where DevOps comes in the picture it automates the process with the help of various CI/CD Tools Jenkins etc.

# Why DevOps?

Back in the days application deployment process was manual there were several roles like Developer, Server Admin , System admin . There was different teams for each tasks due to several teams worked separately which often caused delays, bugs, and communication gaps. DevOps bridges this gap by encouraging collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement

System Admin - create physical server hardware

Server Admin - perform a task like setting up Linux, Networking, Monitoring, Access control

Build & Release - Make a executable build on server and deploy on server

Tester - Test the application if everything works as expected or not

In todays world all of these tasks are handled by single team through DevOps Engineer

Some key benefits of DevOps include:

* üöÄ **Faster delivery** of software updates
    
* ‚úÖ **Improved reliability** and fewer bugs
    
* ü§ù **Better collaboration** between teams
    
* üîÑ **Continuous feedback loop** for quick improvements
    

# How DevOps work?

DevOps relies on several tools to make process faster

Continuous Integration (CI) - A team of software developers merge their code on GitHub repository to catch bug quickly.

Continuous Delivery(CD) - Changes in the code are automatically detected and prepared for release.

Automation - Few tasks are repetitive so they are automated like testing, deployment and monitoring.

Monitoring - Systems are continuously monitored to detect problems quickly and improve performance.

# What are the different DevOps Tools?

Remember DevOps isn‚Äôt about tools only but tools makes it a powerful process.

* **Git & GitHub/GitLab** ‚Äì Version control and collaboration
    
* **Jenkins** ‚Äì Automation server for CI/CD
    
* **Docker** ‚Äì Containerization of applications
    
* **Kubernetes** ‚Äì Orchestration of containers or handling of containers
    
* **AWS, Azure, GCP** ‚Äì Cloud platforms that support DevOps practices
