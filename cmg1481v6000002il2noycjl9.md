## What is SDLC?

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a process followed by the industry to design, develop, and test software products to ensure high quality. It consists of several phases, including **Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment**. This is a standard process followed across the industry. The same process is repeated whenever a new feature or design is implemented in the software.

* ### **Defining**
    
    In this phase, customer requirements are documented. This document is called the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**. It contains all the information related to the software, including its features, functionality, and design expectations.
    
* ### **Designing**
    
    In the Designing phase there are two levels of design a **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**.
    
    1. **High level Design(HLD)**
        
        Focuses on the overall system architecture, scalability, security, and main components of the software.
        
    2. **Low level Design(LLD)**
        
        In Low level design(LLD) architect decided the stack like programming language, framework, library, UI design and UX.
        
    
* ### **Building**
    
    In this stage, software development is started according to the requirements in the SRS document. The source code is pushed to a **centralized code repository**, usually using **Git**.
    
* ### **Testing**
    
    Software is deployed on a **testing server** to check whether it works as expected. This ensures all features function correctly working or not. Any issues that might occur in test server can be fixed immediately. The **Quality Assurance (QA) team** performs this testing task. They check the software thoroughly before it goes live.
    
* ### **Deployment**
    
    Once testing is completed and everything is working as expected, the software is deployed on the **production server** and becomes available for use by the end users or customers.

## Role of DevOps Engineer in SDLC

A **DevOps engineer** automates the SDLC process to improve efficiency and reduce delivery time. They write **automation scripts**, set up **CI/CD pipelines**, and use tools like **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes**. This reduces manual work, ensures faster deployment, and maintains high-quality software delivery.

## Short Forms & Abbreviations

* **SDLC** – Software Development Life Cycle
    
* **SRS** – Software Requirements Specification
    
* **HLD** – High-Level Design
    
* **LLD** – Low-Level Design
    
* **QA** – Quality Assurance
    
* **CI/CD** – Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
    
* **UI** – User Interface
    
* **UX** – User Experience
    

### **Conclusion**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) provides a clear roadmap for building high-quality software efficiently and systematically. Each phase — from requirement gathering to deployment — plays a vital role in ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

With the rise of modern technologies, the role of DevOps in SDLC has become more crucial than ever. Automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment have made the process faster and more reliable.
