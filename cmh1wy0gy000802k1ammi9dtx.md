## üß© What is Version Control System (VCS)?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers **track and manage changes** in code.  
Imagine you are working on a project and want to keep older versions safe ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what VCS does.

‚úÖ **Key benefits:**

* Keeps a record of every change in your project
    
* Helps multiple developers work together on the same code
    
* Allows you to **revert** to an older version if something breaks
    
* Reduces confusion and increases collaboration
    

**Example:** Git, SVN, CVS, Mercurial etc.

## üß† What is Git?

**Git** is an **open-source, distributed version control system** developed by **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux).  
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project **without overwriting each other‚Äôs code**.

üü¢ **Main features of Git:**

* Distributed architecture (everyone has a local copy of the repo)
    
* Branching and merging made easy
    
* Speed and efficiency
    
* Works offline (no internet needed to commit)
    

Git is the **most popular VCS** today and is used by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

## ‚öîÔ∏è CVS, SVN vs Git ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Difference?

Before Git, tools like **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)** and **SVN (Subversion)** were used.  
But Git changed the game!

| Feature | CVS / SVN (Old Systems) | Git (Modern System) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Centralized | Distributed |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Offline work | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Branching | Complex | Easy & Lightweight |
| Data Security | Less Secure | Highly Secure |

üëâ **In short:** Git is **faster, safer, and easier to use** than traditional systems like CVS or SVN.

## üåê Centralized vs Distributed Version Control Systems

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | One central server stores all versions of the code. Developers must stay online to access or commit code. | SVN, CVS |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Every developer has a complete copy (repository) of the code, including its full history. You can work offline and sync changes later. | Git, Mercurial |

üí° **Why Git wins:** It‚Äôs distributed ‚Äî even if the server goes down, your local copy still has the entire project.

## üêô What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories.  
It lets developers store, share, and collaborate on projects using Git.

üß∞ **In short:**

* Git = Version control system
    
* GitHub = Place to host Git repositories online
    

Other Git hosting platforms: **GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge**

üí¨ Think of **GitHub as social media for developers** ‚Äî you can share code, contribute to others‚Äô projects, and showcase your portfolio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Initialize Git in Your System?

To start using Git, you first need to install and initialize it in your local project folder.

### Step 1: Install Git

1. Go to the official website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    
2. Download according to your OS (Windows / Mac / Linux).
    
3. Install using default settings.
    

Once installed, verify it by running this command in your terminal or Git Bash:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, Git is successfully installed. ‚úÖ

---

### Step 2: Initialize Local Repository

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```

* This command turns your project folder into a Git repository.
    
* It creates a hidden `.git` folder to track changes.
    

---

### Step 3: Create a Remote Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub.
    
2. Click **New Repository** ‚Üí give it a name ‚Üí click **Create repository**.
    
3. Copy the HTTPS URL, e.g.:
    

```bash
https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

---

### Step 4: Add Remote to Your Local Repo

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

* Now your local repository is connected to the remote repository called `origin`.
    

---

### Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### Step 6: Push to GitHub Using Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Run:
    

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

* Git will prompt:
    

```bash
Username: <your GitHub username>
Password: <paste your personal access token here>
```

> Paste your **PAT** instead of your password.

* Adjust the branch name if it‚Äôs not `main`.
    

---

### Step 7: Optional ‚Äî Store Credentials for Future Pushes

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

* This stores your PAT locally.
    
* Future pushes/pulls will not require entering the token again.
    

---

## **Optional Shortcut ‚Äî PAT in URL (Not Recommended for Security)**

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<USERNAME>:<PAT>@github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

* **Warning:** The token will be stored in your shell history, which is insecure.
    
* Safer approach: use the prompt + credential helper method.
    

---

## **Summary Workflow**

```bash
cd project-folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
# Username: your GitHub username
# Password: paste your PAT
git config --global credential.helper store   # optional
```

---

### üîÅ Step 8: Future Changes Workflow

Once setup is done, your normal day-to-day workflow looks like this:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated project"
git push
```

üí° **Shortcut Tip:** Combine add + commit + push in one go (for small updates):

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Quick update" && git push
```

## üåø What is Branching in Git?

Branching in Git means creating a **separate line of development** within the same project.  
It allows multiple people (or even a single developer) to work on different features, fixes, or experiments ‚Äî **without affecting the main codebase**.

Think of a branch as a **copy of your project** where you can make changes freely.  
Once your changes are complete and tested, you can **merge** them back into the main branch.

---

### üß± Example

Let‚Äôs say you are building a website:

* The `main` branch has your live, working site.
    
* You create a new branch called `feature/contact-form` to add a new contact page.
    
* You work on it, test it, and when it‚Äôs ready ‚Äî merge it back into `main`.
    

If something goes wrong, your main website still remains safe.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why Branching is Useful

* Allows multiple developers to work **in parallel**
    
* Keeps the **main branch stable**
    
* Makes **code reviews and testing** easier
    
* Supports **experimentation** without risk
    

---

## **How to Contribute to Open Source ‚Äì Step by Step**

Contributing to open source is a great way to improve your skills, collaborate with developers worldwide, and give back to the community. Here‚Äôs a simple step-by-step guide:

---

### **Step 1: Find a Project**

* Choose a project you are interested in or familiar with.
    
* Use platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
    
* Look for repositories labeled **‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù** or **‚Äúbeginner-friendly‚Äù** if you are new.
    

---

### **Step 2: Fork the Repository**

* Go to the repository you want to contribute to.
    
* Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner.
    
* This creates your **own copy** of the repo under your GitHub account.
    

---

### **Step 3: Clone Your Forked Repo**

* Copy the **HTTPS or SSH URL** of your forked repo.
    
* Clone it to your local machine:
    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
cd project-name
```

---

### **Step 4: Create a New Branch**

* Always create a new branch for your changes instead of working on `main`:
    

```bash
git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-branch
```

* Name it clearly, e.g., `fix-login-bug` or `add-dark-mode`.
    

---

### **Step 5: Make Changes**

* Edit the code, documentation, or other files as needed.
    
* Test your changes locally to ensure everything works.
    

---

### **Step 6: Stage and Commit Changes**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X / Fix bug Y"
```

* Keep your commit messages **clear and descriptive**.
    

---

### **Step 7: Push Changes to Your Fork**

```bash
git push origin feature-or-bugfix-branch
```

* This uploads your branch and changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
    

---

### **Step 8: Create a Pull Request (PR**[**)**](https://github.com)

* Go to your fork on GitHub.
    
* Click **Compare & pull request** for your branch.
    
* Write a clear PR title and description explaining your changes.
    
* Submit the PR to the original repository.
    

---

### **Step 9: Review and Respond**

* Maintainers may review your PR and request changes.
    
* Make any requested changes in your branch and push again[:](https://github.com)
    

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update based on review"
git push origin feature-or-bugfix-branch
```

---

### **Done!**

* Once your PR is merged, congratulations! üéâ
    
* You have officially contributed to an open-source project.
    

---

### **Tips for Beginners**

* Start with **documentation or small bug fixes** if coding contribution feels intimidating.
    
* Follow the **project‚Äôs contribution guidelines** (`CONTRIBUTING.md` if available).
    
* Be polite, patient, and professional while interacting with maintainers.

---

### üß© Common Branch Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git branch` | Lists all existing branches |
| `git branch <name>` | Creates a new branch |
| `git checkout <branch>` | Switches to a specific branch |
| `g``it checkout -b <branch>` | Creates and switches to a new branch |
| `git merge <branch>` | Merges another branch into the current one |
| `git branch -d <branch>` | Deletes a branch |

## **What is Branching Strategy in Git?**

A branching strategy defines how different branches are used and managed in a Git workflow to ensure smooth development, testing, and deployment.

---

**üîπ main / master branch:**

* Always contains the **latest stable and production-ready code**.
    
* Only **tested and approved code** from the release or hotfix branches gets merged here.
    
* This is the branch that goes to **production deployment**.
    

---

**üîπ feature branch:**

* Used for **developing new features or functionalities**.
    
* Created from the `develop` branch (or `main` if no develop branch exists).
    
* Once the feature is complete and tested, it‚Äôs merged back into `develop`.
    

---

**üîπ release branch:**

* Created when you are **preparing for a new production release**.
    
* Used for **final testing, bug fixes, and version tagging**.
    
* After testing, it‚Äôs merged into both `main` (for deployment) and `develop` (to sync fixes).
    

---

**üîπ hotfix / bugfix branch:**

* Used for **urgent fixes directly on production**.
    
* Created from the `main` branch to fix live issues quickly.
    
* After fixing, merged into both `main` and `develop`.
    

---

## What is Git Hooks?

**Git Hooks** are scripts that run automatically when certain events occur in a Git repository ‚Äî such as a **commit**, **push**, or **merge**.

In simple terms, they are small automation tools that execute at different stages of the Git workflow.  
For example:

* When you run `git commit`, a **pre-commit hook** can automatically format your code or run tests.
    
* When you run `git push`, a **pre-push hook** can ensure that all tests pass before the code is pushed.
    

### üß© Common Git Hooks

| Hook Name | Triggered When | Example Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | Before a commit is made | Lint or format code |
| `commit-msg` | After commit message is entered | Validate commit message format |
| `pre-push` | Before code is pushed | Run tests before pushing |
| `post-merge` | After a merge completes | Reinstall dependencies if required |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Location

Hooks are stored inside the `.git/hooks/` directory of your repository.  
By default, you‚Äôll find sample hook files there (like `pre-commit.sample`).  
You can rename them, make them executable, and add your own custom automation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is GitHub Actions?

**GitHub Actions** is a powerful CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) tool built right into **GitHub**.  
It allows developers to **automate workflows** ‚Äî like testing, building, and deploying code ‚Äî directly from their repositories.

In simple terms, it helps you run scripts automatically whenever something happens in your repo ‚Äî for example, when you **push code**, **open a pull request**, or **merge changes**.

### üöÄ Why Use GitHub Actions?

* **Automate repetitive tasks** like testing and deployment
    
* **Improve code quality** by running lint checks automatically
    
* **Save time** by building, testing, and deploying your app right from GitHub
    
* **Supports any language or platform** (Node.js, Python, Docker, etc.)
    

### üß© Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Workflow** | The entire automation process (defined in a `.yml` file) |
| **Job** | A set of steps that run on the same machine |
| **Step** | An individual task (like running a command or script) |
| **Action** | A reusable component or script used in workflows |
| **Runner** | The server that runs your workflow (GitHub-hosted or self-hosted) |

### üìÅ Where It Lives

GitHub Actions workflows are stored in your repo under:

```bash
.github/workflows/
```

Each workflow file is written in **YAML**, for example:  
`deploy.yml`, `test.yml`, or `ci.yml`.
