## 🖥️ What is a Computer Network?

A **computer network** is a system where two or more devices (like computers, laptops, mobiles, printers, or servers) are connected together to **share data and resources**.

The main purpose of a network is:

* To **share resources** (like the internet, files, or printers)
    
* To **enable communication** (emails, chats, or video calls)
    

**Examples:**

* Home Wi-Fi (small local network)
    
* Office LAN (Local Area Network)
    
* The Internet (a huge Wide Area Network)
    

## 🌍 How Internet Works ?

* The **internet** is a huge global network that connects billions of devices — computers, phones, and servers — using cables, satellites, and wireless signals.
    
* When you **type a website name** (like [*netflix.com*](http://netflix.com)) and press Enter, your device first sends a **request** to your **router** (the small box that gives you Wi-Fi).
    
* Your **router** passes this request to your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** — for example, Jio, Airtel, or BSNL.
    
* The ISP checks its **DNS servers** to find the exact IP address of that website.
    
* Once the IP is found, your request travels through several **routers and network hubs** that act like checkpoints along the journey.
    
* If the website’s server is located in another country, your data often travels through **undersea fiber-optic cables** that connect continents! 🌊
    
* The request finally reaches the **web server** that hosts the website (for example, Netflix’s server).
    
* That **server sends data back** — text, images, and videos — again through the same route, just in reverse.
    
* Your **browser** receives all this data and displays the full webpage within a few seconds.
    
* In simple words: **the internet works like a digital postal system**, sending and receiving small **packets of information** between your device and servers worldwide.
    

## What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet — it converts human-friendly domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses. For example, when you type [**google.com**](http://google.com) or [**netflix.com**](http://netflix.com) in your browser, DNS translates these names into their actual IP addresses (like `142.250.183.100`) so your device can connect to the correct server. Without DNS, we’d have to remember long strings of numbers instead of simple website names.

## 🌐 What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network.  
It works like an **identity card** that helps devices recognize and communicate with each other.

🧠 **Example:**

* IPv4: `192.168.1.10`
    
* IPv6: `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`
    

## What are IPV4 and IPV6?

**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**

* The older version of IP.
    
* Uses 32-bit addresses.
    
* Example: `192.168.1.1`
    
* Can generate around **4 billion unique addresses**.
    

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**

* The newer version.
    
* Uses 128-bit addresses.
    
* Example: `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`
    
* Provides **trillions of addresses** — solving the IPv4 shortage problem.
    

## What is MAC Address and How It’s Different from IP Address?

* **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address) is a **unique hardware identifier** assigned to a network device like your computer, phone, or router.
    
    * Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
        
    * It is **permanent** and does not change unless the hardware is modified.
        
* **IP Address** is the **logical address** assigned to a device on a network so it can communicate with other devices.
    
    * Example: `192.168.1.10`
        
    * It can **change** depending on the network (dynamic IP) or stay the same (static IP).
        
* **Key Differences:**
    
    | Feature | MAC Address | IP Address |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Type | Hardware/Physical | Logical/Software |
    | Uniqueness | Unique worldwide | Unique per network |
    | Permanence | Permanent (usually) | Can change (dynamic) |
    | Purpose | Identifies device on **local network** | Identifies device on **internet/network** |
    
* In simple words: **MAC = device’s ID card**, **IP = device’s address on the network map**.
    

## What is subnet (sub networking)?

**Subnetting** means dividing a large network into smaller, manageable parts called **subnets**.  
This helps improve performance, management, and security.

🧠 **Example:**  
If an office network has 100 devices, you can divide them into 3 subnets:

* HR Department
    
* IT Department
    
* Finance Department
    

This way, one department’s traffic doesn’t interfere with another.

### What is public subnet and private subnet?

**Public Subnet:**

* Directly accessible from the Internet.
    
* Example: Web servers, public APIs.
    

**Private Subnet:**

* Not directly accessible from the Internet.
    
* Example: Databases, backend services.
    

### Advantages of creating subnet

* **Security:** Keeps sensitive data separate.
    
* **Privacy:** Controls who can access what.
    
* **Isolation:** One subnet issue won’t affect others.
    

## 📏 What is a CIDR Range?

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** defines how many IP addresses a network can have.

🧠 **Examples:**

* `192.168.1.0/24` → 256 IPs
    
* `10.0.0.0/16` → 65,536 IPs
    

The number after “/” shows how many bits are fixed — fewer bits mean more available IPs.

## 🔌 What are Ports?

**Ports** are like doors through which data enters or leaves a device.  
Each port is assigned to a specific service.

🧠 **Common Ports:**

* Port 80 → HTTP (Websites)
    
* Port 443 → HTTPS (Secure Websites)
    
* Port 22 → SSH (Remote Login)
    
* Port 25 → SMTP (Email)

## ⚙️ **What is TCP Handshake?**

The **TCP Handshake** is the process used to **establish a reliable connection** between a client (like your computer) and a server (like a website).

It ensures that **both sides are ready** to send and receive data properly.

This process is known as the **3-Way Handshake**.

---

## 🔹 **The 3-Way Handshake (Connection Establishment)**

It happens in **three main steps**:

### **Step 1 – SYN (Synchronize)**

📤 **Client → Server**

The client says:

> “Hey server, I want to start a connection.”

It sends a **SYN** packet (synchronize) that contains a **sequence number** to start the communication.

---

### **Step 2 – SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledge)**

📥 **Server → Client**

The server replies:

> “Okay client, I got your request. Here’s my sequence number.”

It sends **two flags**:

* **SYN** – to synchronize its own sequence number.
    
* **ACK** – to acknowledge the client’s SYN.
    

---

### **Step 3 – ACK (Acknowledge)**

📤 **Client → Server**

The client replies:

> “Thanks! Let’s start sending data.”

It sends an **ACK** packet confirming the server’s SYN.

✅ Connection is now **established** — both sides can start data transfer safely.

---

## 🔸 **Connection Termination (4-Way Handshake)**

When the data transfer is finished, both sides close the connection using **four steps**:

1. **Client → Server:** FIN (Finish — client wants to close connection)
    
2. **Server → Client:** ACK (Acknowledges FIN)
    
3. **Server → Client:** FIN (Server also wants to close)
    
4. **Client → Server:** ACK (Acknowledges server’s FIN)
    

Now the connection is **properly closed**.

## 🧱 What is OSI Model?

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** explains **how data travels** through a network.  
It has **7 layers**, each responsible for a specific task.

**Layer 7** - Application Layer – User make https/http request or upload files message etc.

**Layer 6** - Presentation layer– Data format and encryption is done in this layer.

**Layer 5** - Session Layer – Manages connection between systems.

**Layer 4** - Transport Layer - Data is segmented in small small chunks for the fast transmission of data. in this layer protocol is also defined whether you want to use TCP/UDP.

**Layer 3** - Network Layer – In this layer router receives the segments(chunks) and tells each chunk source IP and destination IP so they have to follow this in order to reach faster to server. Now data is in the form of packets.

**Layer 2** - Data Link Layer – Now Data is received at switches such as ethernet port. Now packets are converted into frames here along with frames MAC address is also attached.

**Layer 1** - Physical – Now data comes to optical cable. Optical cable only understands electronic signals and it sends data very fast.

## What is the TCP/IP Model?

* **TCP/IP** stands for **Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol** — it’s the **foundation of the internet**.
    
* It defines a set of **rules and protocols** that allow devices to communicate over networks, including the internet.
    
* Unlike the OSI model with 7 layers, TCP/IP has **4 main layers**:
    
    1. **Application Layer** – Includes **web, email, FTP, DNS** and other services that users interact with.
        
    2. **Transport Layer** – Ensures **reliable data delivery** using **TCP** or faster but less reliable **UDP**.
        
    3. **Internet Layer** – Responsible for **IP addressing and routing** of packets across networks.
        
    4. **Network Interface (Link) Layer** – Handles **physical connection** and data transfer over hardware like cables and Wi-Fi.
        
* **Example:** When you open [**netflix.com**](http://netflix.com), your computer uses **TCP/IP** to send requests to Netflix’s server and receive the data, layer by layer.
    
* In simple words: **TCP/IP is like the rulebook of the internet**, telling devices how to send, receive, and route data efficiently.
    

## 🛡️ What is a VPN and How Does It Work?

* **VPN** stands for **Virtual Private Network** — it creates a **secure, encrypted connection** between your device and the internet.
    
* When you use a VPN, all your internet traffic is **routed through a VPN server** before reaching the websites or services you access.
    
* This hides your **real IP address** and protects your **data from hackers, ISPs, and public Wi-Fi snoopers**.
    
* **How it works:**
    
    1. You connect to a VPN server using VPN software.
        
    2. The VPN encrypts your data into a secure “tunnel.”
        
    3. Your encrypted data travels through the VPN server to its destination on the internet.
        
    4. The website sees the VPN server’s IP instead of your real IP.
        
* **Example Use Cases:**
    
    * Accessing region-restricted content (like streaming Netflix in another country).
        
    * Securely connecting to a company network from home.
        
    * Protecting your data on public Wi-Fi.
        
* In simple words: **a VPN is like a private, secure tunnel for your internet traffic** — it keeps your identity and data safe while online.
    

## 🏠 What is LAN and WAN

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**
    
    * A LAN is a **small network** that connects devices in a **limited area** like a home, office, or school.
        
    * Devices in a LAN can **share files, printers, and the internet** easily.
        
    * **Example:** Home Wi-Fi connecting your laptop, phone, and smart TV.
        
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
    
    * A WAN is a **large network** that spans **cities, countries, or even the whole world**.
        
    * It connects multiple LANs together so devices can communicate over long distances.
        
    * **Example:** The Internet is the largest WAN, connecting millions of LANs worldwide.
        
* **Key Difference:**
    
    | Feature | LAN | WAN |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Area | Small (home/office) | Large (global) |
    | Speed | High (fast local transfer) | Lower (depends on internet) |
    | Ownership | Usually private | Can be public or multiple owners |
    
* In simple words: **LAN is your local network at home or office, WAN is the global network connecting all LANs — like the Internet.**
    

## ☁️ What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?

A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a **virtual network inside the cloud** (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) where you can securely manage your resources.

In a VPC, you can define:

* IP address range
    
* Public and private subnets
    
* Routing rules
    
* Internet gateways
    

Basically, a VPC is your **own private, secure network in the cloud**.

## EC2 Access request flow on VPC?

## 🧭 **Step-by-Step Flow:**

### **1️⃣ Client (User) Sends Request**

The user types something like [`http://ec2-public-ip`](http://ec2-public-ip) or [`http://mywebsite.com`](http://mywebsite.com) 👉 This sends a request over the **Internet** using **DNS + TCP/IP**.

---

### **2️⃣ DNS Resolution (Optional but Common)**

If user used a domain name (like [`myapp.com`](http://myapp.com)):

* Browser asks **DNS** → “What’s the IP of [myapp.com](http://myapp.com)?”
    
* DNS gives the **public IP address** of your AWS resource (e.g., Load Balancer or EC2).
    

---

### 3️⃣ Internet Gateway (IGW)

Once it reaches AWS’s network, it first enters your **VPC** through the **Internet Gateway**.  
This gateway connects your **VPC** (private AWS network) to the **outside world (Internet)**.

🧩 **Function:** Allows inbound and outbound traffic to/from public IPs.

---

### 4️⃣ Load Balancer (Public)

After the Internet Gateway, the request goes to your **Public Load Balancer**  
(e.g., **Application Load Balancer — ALB** or **Network Load Balancer — NLB**).

💡 **Role of Load Balancer:**

* Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
    
* Provides one public DNS endpoint (like [`myapp.alb.amazonaws.com`](http://myapp.alb.amazonaws.com)).
    
* Improves performance & high availability.
    

---

### 5️⃣ Route Table (inside the VPC)

Now inside the VPC, **Route Tables** decide *where next* the packet goes.  
For example:

* Requests to internal servers → forward to **Private Subnet**.
    
* Responses to the internet → forward back to **Internet Gateway**.
    

---

### 6️⃣ **Security Groups & NACLs**

Before data reaches EC2:

* **Security Group (SG):** Acts like a virtual firewall attached to EC2.  
    It must allow inbound traffic on port 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS).
    
* **NACL (Network ACL):** Controls traffic at subnet level (optional additional security).
    

If both allow, traffic proceeds.

---

### 6️⃣ Subnets

There are typically two subnet types:

* **Public Subnet:** Has route to Internet Gateway → used by Load Balancer.
    
* **Private Subnet:** No direct internet access → used by EC2s (for security).
    

The Load Balancer is in the **public subnet**, and it sends traffic to EC2s inside **private subnets**.

---

### **7️⃣ NAT Gateway (If EC2 is Private)**

If your EC2 instance is in a **Private Subnet**, it **doesn’t have direct internet access**.  
So, for outbound communication (like software updates, API calls), it uses:

* **NAT Gateway** placed in a **Public Subnet**.
    
* NAT forwards outgoing traffic to the internet safely (without exposing EC2’s private IP).
    

---

### 8️⃣ EC2 Instance

Finally, the load balancer forwards the request to one of the healthy **EC2 instances** (target group).  
The EC2 runs your **web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Node.js)** which processes the request and returns a response.

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**<mark>Q1. What’s the difference between an IP address and a MAC address?</mark>**  
→ An IP address identifies a device on a network, while a MAC address identifies the **physical hardware** (like your Wi-Fi card).

**<mark>Q2. Why do we have both IPv4 and IPv6?</mark>**  
→ IPv4 addresses are limited; IPv6 was created to provide a much larger pool of unique addresses.

**<mark>Q3. Can two devices have the same IP address?</mark>**  
→ Not on the same network. If it happens, it causes an **IP conflict**, and one device won’t connect properly.

**<mark>Q4. What’s the main use of a subnet?</mark>**  
→ To **organize, secure, and optimize** large networks by dividing them into smaller sections.

**<mark>Q5. How is WAN different from the Internet?</mark>**

→ **WAN (Wide Area Network)** is any network that spans a large geographic area and connects multiple LANs.

The **Internet** is actually the **largest WAN** in the world, connecting millions of LANs and WANs globally. In simple words: **all Internet is a WAN, but not all WANs are the Internet**.

**Example:** A company’s private WAN connecting offices in different cities is a WAN, but it may not be part of the Internet.

**<mark>Q6. How is the TCP/IP model different from the OSI model?</mark>**

* **OSI Model** has **7 layers**: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. It is a **theoretical framework** used to understand how data flows in a network.
    
* **TCP/IP Model** has **4 layers**: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application. It is a **practical model** used in real-world internet communication.
    
* **Key Differences:**
    
    | Feature | OSI Model | TCP/IP Model |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Layers | 7 | 4 |
    | Usage | Conceptual/theoretical | Practical/protocol suite |
    | Origin | Developed by ISO | Developed by DARPA for the Internet |
    
* In simple words: **OSI helps you learn networking concepts, TCP/IP shows how real networks like the Internet actually work.**
