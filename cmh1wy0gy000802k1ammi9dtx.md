## üß© What is Version Control System (VCS)?

A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps developers **track and manage changes** in code.  
Imagine you are working on a project and want to keep older versions safe ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly what VCS does.

‚úÖ **Key benefits:**

* Keeps a record of every change in your project
    
* Helps multiple developers work together on the same code
    
* Allows you to **revert** to an older version if something breaks
    
* Reduces confusion and increases collaboration
    

**Example:** Git, SVN, CVS, Mercurial etc.

## üß† What is Git?

**Git** is an **open-source, distributed version control system** developed by **Linus Torvalds** (the creator of Linux).  
It allows multiple developers to work on the same project **without overwriting each other‚Äôs code**.

üü¢ **Main features of Git:**

* Distributed architecture (everyone has a local copy of the repo)
    
* Branching and merging made easy
    
* Speed and efficiency
    
* Works offline (no internet needed to commit)
    

Git is the **most popular VCS** today and is used by companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

## ‚öîÔ∏è CVS, SVN vs Git ‚Äì What‚Äôs the Difference?

Before Git, tools like **CVS (Concurrent Versions System)** and **SVN (Subversion)** were used.  
But Git changed the game!

| Feature | CVS / SVN (Old Systems) | Git (Modern System) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Centralized | Distributed |
| Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Offline work | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Branching | Complex | Easy & Lightweight |
| Data Security | Less Secure | Highly Secure |

üëâ **In short:** Git is **faster, safer, and easier to use** than traditional systems like CVS or SVN.

## üåê Centralized vs Distributed Version Control Systems

| Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Centralized VCS (CVCS)** | One central server stores all versions of the code. Developers must stay online to access or commit code. | SVN, CVS |
| **Distributed VCS (DVCS)** | Every developer has a complete copy (repository) of the code, including its full history. You can work offline and sync changes later. | Git, Mercurial |

üí° **Why Git wins:** It‚Äôs distributed ‚Äî even if the server goes down, your local copy still has the entire project.

## üêô What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **cloud-based hosting platform** for Git repositories.  
It lets developers store, share, and collaborate on projects using Git.

üß∞ **In short:**

* Git = Version control system
    
* GitHub = Place to host Git repositories online
    

Other Git hosting platforms: **GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge**

üí¨ Think of **GitHub as social media for developers** ‚Äî you can share code, contribute to others‚Äô projects, and showcase your portfolio.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Initialize Git in Your System?

To start using Git, you first need to install and initialize it in your local project folder.

### Step 1: Install Git

1. Go to the official website: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    
2. Download according to your OS (Windows / Mac / Linux).
    
3. Install using default settings.
    

Once installed, verify it by running this command in your terminal or Git Bash:

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, Git is successfully installed. ‚úÖ

---

### Step 2: Initialize Local Repository

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
git init
```

* This command turns your project folder into a Git repository.
    
* It creates a hidden `.git` folder to track changes.
    

---

### Step 3: Create a Remote Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to GitHub.
    
2. Click **New Repository** ‚Üí give it a name ‚Üí click **Create repository**.
    
3. Copy the HTTPS URL, e.g.:
    

```bash
https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

---

### Step 4: Add Remote to Your Local Repo

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

* Now your local repository is connected to the remote repository called `origin`.
    

---

### Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### Step 6: Push to GitHub Using Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Run:
    

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

* Git will prompt:
    

```bash
Username: <your GitHub username>
Password: <paste your personal access token here>
```

> Paste your **PAT** instead of your password.

* Adjust the branch name if it‚Äôs not `main`.
    

---

### Step 7: Optional ‚Äî Store Credentials for Future Pushes

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

* This stores your PAT locally.
    
* Future pushes/pulls will not require entering the token again.
    

---

## **Optional Shortcut ‚Äî PAT in URL (Not Recommended for Security)**

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://<USERNAME>:<PAT>@github.com/username/repo-name.git
```

* **Warning:** The token will be stored in your shell history, which is insecure.
    
* Safer approach: use the prompt + credential helper method.
    

---

## **Summary Workflow**

```bash
cd project-folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
# Username: your GitHub username
# Password: paste your PAT
git config --global credential.helper store   # optional
```

---

### üîÅ Step 8: Future Changes Workflow

Once setup is done, your normal day-to-day workflow looks like this:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated project"
git push
```

üí° **Shortcut Tip:** Combine add + commit + push in one go (for small updates):

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Quick update" && git push
```

## üåø What is Branching in Git?

Branching in Git means creating a **separate line of development** within the same project.  
It allows multiple people (or even a single developer) to work on different features, fixes, or experiments ‚Äî **without affecting the main codebase**.

Think of a branch as a **copy of your project** where you can make changes freely.  
Once your changes are complete and tested, you can **merge** them back into the main branch.

---

### üß± Example

Let‚Äôs say you are building a website:

* The `main` branch has your live, working site.
    
* You create a new branch called `feature/contact-form` to add a new contact page.
    
* You work on it, test it, and when it‚Äôs ready ‚Äî merge it back into `main`.
    

If something goes wrong, your main website still remains safe.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why Branching is Useful

* Allows multiple developers to work **in parallel**
    
* Keeps the **main branch stable**
    
* Makes **code reviews and testing** easier
    
* Supports **experimentation** without risk
    

---

### üß© Common Branch Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git branch` | Lists all existing branches |
| `git branch <name>` | Creates a new branch |
| `git checkout <branch>` | Switches to a specific branch |
| `git checkout -b <branch>` | Creates and switches to a new branch |
| `git merge <branch>` | Merges another branch into the current one |
| `git branch -d <branch>` | Deletes a branch |

## **What is Branching Strategy in Git?**

A branching strategy defines how different branches are used and managed in a Git workflow to ensure smooth development, testing, and deployment.

---

**üîπ main / master branch:**

* Always contains the **latest stable and production-ready code**.
    
* Only **tested and approved code** from the release or hotfix branches gets merged here.
    
* This is the branch that goes to **production deployment**.
    

---

**üîπ feature branch:**

* Used for **developing new features or functionalities**.
    
* Created from the `develop` branch (or `main` if no develop branch exists).
    
* Once the feature is complete and tested, it‚Äôs merged back into `develop`.
    

---

**üîπ release branch:**

* Created when you are **preparing for a new production release**.
    
* Used for **final testing, bug fixes, and version tagging**.
    
* After testing, it‚Äôs merged into both `main` (for deployment) and `develop` (to sync fixes).
    

---

**üîπ hotfix / bugfix branch:**

* Used for **urgent fixes directly on production**.
    
* Created from the `main` branch to fix live issues quickly.
    
* After fixing, merged into both `main` and `develop`.
