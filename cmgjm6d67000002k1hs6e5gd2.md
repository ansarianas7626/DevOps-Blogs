## 🖥️ What is a Computer Network?

A **computer network** is a system where two or more devices (like computers, laptops, mobiles, printers, or servers) are connected together to **share data and resources**.

The main purpose of a network is:

* To **share resources** (like the internet, files, or printers)
    
* To **enable communication** (emails, chats, or video calls)
    

**Examples:**

* Home Wi-Fi (small local network)
    
* Office LAN (Local Area Network)
    
* The Internet (a huge Wide Area Network)
    

## 🌍 How Internet Works ?

* The **internet** is a huge global network that connects billions of devices — computers, phones, and servers — using cables, satellites, and wireless signals.
    
* When you **type a website name** (like [*netflix.com*](http://netflix.com)) and press Enter, your device first sends a **request** to your **router** (the small box that gives you Wi-Fi).
    
* Your **router** passes this request to your **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** — for example, Jio, Airtel, or BSNL.
    
* The ISP checks its **DNS servers** to find the exact IP address of that website.
    
* Once the IP is found, your request travels through several **routers and network hubs** that act like checkpoints along the journey.
    
* If the website’s server is located in another country, your data often travels through **undersea fiber-optic cables** that connect continents! 🌊
    
* The request finally reaches the **web server** that hosts the website (for example, Netflix’s server).
    
* That **server sends data back** — text, images, and videos — again through the same route, just in reverse.
    
* Your **browser** receives all this data and displays the full webpage within a few seconds.
    
* In simple words: **the internet works like a digital postal system**, sending and receiving small **packets of information** between your device and servers worldwide.
    

## What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet — it converts human-friendly domain names into computer-friendly IP addresses. For example, when you type [**google.com**](http://google.com) or [**netflix.com**](http://netflix.com) in your browser, DNS translates these names into their actual IP addresses (like `142.250.183.100`) so your device can connect to the correct server. Without DNS, we’d have to remember long strings of numbers instead of simple website names.

## 🌐 What is an IP Address?

An **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)** is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network.  
It works like an **identity card** that helps devices recognize and communicate with each other.

🧠 **Example:**

* IPv4: `192.168.1.10`
    
* IPv6: `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`
    

## What are IPV4 and IPV6?

**IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**

* The older version of IP.
    
* Uses 32-bit addresses.
    
* Example: `192.168.1.1`
    
* Can generate around **4 billion unique addresses**.
    

**IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**

* The newer version.
    
* Uses 128-bit addresses.
    
* Example: `2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2`
    
* Provides **trillions of addresses** — solving the IPv4 shortage problem.
    

## What is MAC Address and How It’s Different from IP Address?

* **MAC Address** (Media Access Control Address) is a **unique hardware identifier** assigned to a network device like your computer, phone, or router.
    
    * Example: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
        
    * It is **permanent** and does not change unless the hardware is modified.
        
* **IP Address** is the **logical address** assigned to a device on a network so it can communicate with other devices.
    
    * Example: `192.168.1.10`
        
    * It can **change** depending on the network (dynamic IP) or stay the same (static IP).
        
* **Key Differences:**
    
    | Feature | MAC Address | IP Address |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Type | Hardware/Physical | Logical/Software |
    | Uniqueness | Unique worldwide | Unique per network |
    | Permanence | Permanent (usually) | Can change (dynamic) |
    | Purpose | Identifies device on **local network** | Identifies device on **internet/network** |
    
* In simple words: **MAC = device’s ID card**, **IP = device’s address on the network map**.
    

## What is subnet (sub networking)?

**Subnetting** means dividing a large network into smaller, manageable parts called **subnets**.  
This helps improve performance, management, and security.

🧠 **Example:**  
If an office network has 100 devices, you can divide them into 3 subnets:

* HR Department
    
* IT Department
    
* Finance Department
    

This way, one department’s traffic doesn’t interfere with another.

### What is public subnet and private subnet?

**Public Subnet:**

* Directly accessible from the Internet.
    
* Example: Web servers, public APIs.
    

**Private Subnet:**

* Not directly accessible from the Internet.
    
* Example: Databases, backend services.
    

### Advantages of creating subnet

* **Security:** Keeps sensitive data separate.
    
* **Privacy:** Controls who can access what.
    
* **Isolation:** One subnet issue won’t affect others.
    

## ☁️ What is a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)?

A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a **virtual network inside the cloud** (like AWS, GCP, or Azure) where you can securely manage your resources.

In a VPC, you can define:

* IP address range
    
* Public and private subnets
    
* Routing rules
    
* Internet gateways
    

Basically, a VPC is your **own private, secure network in the cloud**.

## 📏 What is a CIDR Range?

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** defines how many IP addresses a network can have.

🧠 **Examples:**

* `192.168.1.0/24` → 256 IPs
    
* `10.0.0.0/16` → 65,536 IPs
    

The number after “/” shows how many bits are fixed — fewer bits mean more available IPs.

## 🔌 What are Ports?

**Ports** are like doors through which data enters or leaves a device.  
Each port is assigned to a specific service.

🧠 **Common Ports:**

* Port 80 → HTTP (Websites)
    
* Port 443 → HTTPS (Secure Websites)
    
* Port 22 → SSH (Remote Login)
    
* Port 25 → SMTP (Email)

## 🧱 What is the OSI Model?

The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model** explains **how data travels** through a network.  
It has **7 layers**, each responsible for a specific task.

1. **Application** – Interfaces for users (browser, email, etc.)
    
2. **Presentation** – Data format and encryption
    
3. **Session** – Manages connection between systems
    
4. **Transport** – Reliable data delivery (TCP/UDP)
    
5. **Network** – IP addressing and routing
    
6. **Data Link** – Data transfer between nearby devices
    
7. **Physical** – Hardware and cables
    
    ## What is the TCP/IP Model?
    
    * **TCP/IP** stands for **Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol** — it’s the **foundation of the internet**.
        
    * It defines a set of **rules and protocols** that allow devices to communicate over networks, including the internet.
        
    * Unlike the OSI model with 7 layers, TCP/IP has **4 main layers**:
        
        1. **Application Layer** – Includes **web, email, FTP, DNS** and other services that users interact with.
            
        2. **Transport Layer** – Ensures **reliable data delivery** using **TCP** or faster but less reliable **UDP**.
            
        3. **Internet Layer** – Responsible for **IP addressing and routing** of packets across networks.
            
        4. **Network Interface (Link) Layer** – Handles **physical connection** and data transfer over hardware like cables and Wi-Fi.
            
    
    * **Example:** When you open [**netflix.com**](http://netflix.com), your computer uses **TCP/IP** to send requests to Netflix’s server and receive the data, layer by layer.
        
    * In simple words: **TCP/IP is like the rulebook of the internet**, telling devices how to send, receive, and route data efficiently.
        

## 🛡️ What is a VPN and How Does It Work?

* **VPN** stands for **Virtual Private Network** — it creates a **secure, encrypted connection** between your device and the internet.
    
* When you use a VPN, all your internet traffic is **routed through a VPN server** before reaching the websites or services you access.
    
* This hides your **real IP address** and protects your **data from hackers, ISPs, and public Wi-Fi snoopers**.
    
* **How it works:**
    
    1. You connect to a VPN server using VPN software.
        
    2. The VPN encrypts your data into a secure “tunnel.”
        
    3. Your encrypted data travels through the VPN server to its destination on the internet.
        
    4. The website sees the VPN server’s IP instead of your real IP.
        
* **Example Use Cases:**
    
    * Accessing region-restricted content (like streaming Netflix in another country).
        
    * Securely connecting to a company network from home.
        
    * Protecting your data on public Wi-Fi.
        
* In simple words: **a VPN is like a private, secure tunnel for your internet traffic** — it keeps your identity and data safe while online.
    

## 🏠 What is LAN and WAN

* **LAN (Local Area Network)**
    
    * A LAN is a **small network** that connects devices in a **limited area** like a home, office, or school.
        
    * Devices in a LAN can **share files, printers, and the internet** easily.
        
    * **Example:** Home Wi-Fi connecting your laptop, phone, and smart TV.
        
* **WAN (Wide Area Network)**
    
    * A WAN is a **large network** that spans **cities, countries, or even the whole world**.
        
    * It connects multiple LANs together so devices can communicate over long distances.
        
    * **Example:** The Internet is the largest WAN, connecting millions of LANs worldwide.
        
* **Key Difference:**
    
    | Feature | LAN | WAN |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Area | Small (home/office) | Large (global) |
    | Speed | High (fast local transfer) | Lower (depends on internet) |
    | Ownership | Usually private | Can be public or multiple owners |
    
* In simple words: **LAN is your local network at home or office, WAN is the global network connecting all LANs — like the Internet.**
    

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1. What’s the difference between an IP address and a MAC address?**  
→ An IP address identifies a device on a network, while a MAC address identifies the **physical hardware** (like your Wi-Fi card).

**Q2. Why do we have both IPv4 and IPv6?**  
→ IPv4 addresses are limited; IPv6 was created to provide a much larger pool of unique addresses.

**Q3. Can two devices have the same IP address?**  
→ Not on the same network. If it happens, it causes an **IP conflict**, and one device won’t connect properly.

**Q4. What’s the main use of a subnet?**  
→ To **organize, secure, and optimize** large networks by dividing them into smaller sections.

**Q5. How is WAN different from the Internet?**

→ **WAN (Wide Area Network)** is any network that spans a large geographic area and connects multiple LANs.

* The **Internet** is actually the **largest WAN** in the world, connecting millions of LANs and WANs globally. In simple words: **all Internet is a WAN, but not all WANs are the Internet**.
    

**Example:** A company’s private WAN connecting offices in different cities is a WAN, but it may not be part of the Internet.
