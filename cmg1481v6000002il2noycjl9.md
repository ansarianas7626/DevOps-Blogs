## What is SDLC?

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a process followed by the industry to design, develop, and test software products to ensure high quality. It consists of several phases, including **Planning, Defining, Designing, Building, Testing, and Deployment**. This is a standard process followed across the industry. The same process is repeated whenever a new feature or design is implemented in the software.

    ### **Defining**
    
    In this phase, customer requirements are documented. This document is called the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**. It contains all the information related to the software, including its features, functionality, and design expectations.
    
* ### **Designing**
    
    In the Designing phase there are two levels of design a **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**.
    
    1. **High level Design(HLD)**
        
        Focuses on the overall system architecture, scalability, security, and main components of the software.
        
    2. **Low level Design(LLD)**
        
        In Low level design(LLD) architect decided the stack like programming language, framework, library, UI design and UX.
        
    
* ### **Building**
    
    In this stage, software development is started according to the requirements in the SRS document. The source code is pushed to a **centralized code repository**, usually using **Git**.
    
* ### **Testing**
    
    Software is deployed on a **testing server** to check whether it works as expected. This ensures all features function correctly working or not. Any issues that might occur in test server can be fixed immediately. The **Quality Assurance (QA) team** performs this testing task. They check the software thoroughly before it goes live.
    
* ### **Deployment**
    
    Once testing is completed and everything is working as expected, the software is deployed on the **production server** and becomes available for use by the end users or customers.

## What is Agile Methodology?

Agile methodology is a **modern project management and software development approach** where work is done in **small, manageable parts** instead of completing everything at once.

Agile focuses on:

* Customer satisfaction
    
* Fast delivery
    
* Continuous improvement
    
* Flexibility to change requirements
    

In Agile, the project is divided into **short cycles called sprints**, and after every sprint, feedback is taken and improvements are made.

### Key Features of Agile:

* Work is delivered in small increments
    
* Regular customer feedback
    
* Quick response to changes
    
* Team collaboration is very important
    

## What is Waterfall Methodology?

Waterfall methodology is a **traditional project management approach** where work is completed in a **fixed sequence of steps**.

Each phase must be completed before moving to the next one, just like water flowing downward in a waterfall.

### Phases of Waterfall Methodology:

1. Requirement Analysis
    
2. System Design
    
3. Implementation (Coding)
    
4. Testing
    
5. Deployment
    
6. Maintenance
    

### Key Features of Waterfall:

* Clear and well-defined requirements
    
* No changes allowed once development starts
    
* Easy to manage for small projects
    
* Documentation is very detailed
    

## What is a Sprint?

A Sprint is a **short, fixed-time period** in Agile methodology during which a team completes a specific amount of work.

Usually, a sprint lasts **1 to 4 weeks**.

During a sprint:

* Tasks are planned at the beginning
    
* Development and testing happen together
    
* A working product is delivered at the end
    

### Purpose of a Sprint:

* Deliver usable features quickly
    
* Get fast feedback
    
* Improve product step by step
    

Sprints help teams work faster and stay focused.

## What is Jira Tool?

Jira is a **project management and issue-tracking tool** developed by Atlassian.  
It is mainly used to manage **Agile and Scrum projects**.

### What Jira is used for:

* Creating and tracking tasks (issues)
    
* Managing sprints and backlogs
    
* Tracking bugs and defects
    
* Monitoring project progress with reports
    

### Key Features of Jira:

* Scrum and Kanban boards
    
* Sprint planning and tracking
    
* Issue and bug tracking
    
* Powerful reporting and dashboards
    

Jira helps teams stay organized and deliver projects on time.

## Agile vs Waterfall Methodology

Agile and Waterfall are two different project management methodologies. The main difference between them is **how work is planned, executed, and delivered**.

### Key Differences Between Agile and Waterfall

| Feature | Agile Methodology | Waterfall Methodology |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approach | Iterative and incremental | Linear and sequential |
| Flexibility | Very flexible to changes | Changes are difficult |
| Project Planning | Done in small parts (sprints) | Done once at the beginning |
| Customer Involvement | Continuous involvement | Limited involvement |
| Delivery | Frequent and small releases | Single final delivery |
| Testing | Continuous testing | Testing at the end |
| Risk | Low risk due to early feedback | Higher risk if requirements change |
| Best For | Large, complex, and evolving projects | Small, simple, and fixed-scope projects |

### When to Use Agile?

Agile is best used when:

* Requirements change frequently
    
* Customer feedback is important
    
* Fast delivery is needed
    
* Project is complex or long-term
    

Example: Software applications, web platforms, DevOps projects

---

### When to Use Waterfall?

Waterfall is best used when:

* Requirements are clear and fixed
    
* Changes are not expected
    
* Project is small and well-defined
    
* Strong documentation is required
    

Example: Construction projects, manufacturing, government projects

## Role of DevOps Engineer in SDLC

A **DevOps engineer** automates the SDLC process to improve efficiency and reduce delivery time. They write **automation scripts**, set up **CI/CD pipelines**, and use tools like **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Docker, and Kubernetes**. This reduces manual work, ensures faster deployment, and maintains high-quality software delivery.

## Short Forms & Abbreviations

* **SDLC** – Software Development Life Cycle
    
* **SRS** – Software Requirements Specification
    
* **HLD** – High-Level Design
    
* **LLD** – Low-Level Design
    
* **QA** – Quality Assurance
    
* **CI/CD** – Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
    
* **UI** – User Interface
    
* **UX** – User Experience
    

### **Conclusion**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) provides a clear roadmap for building high-quality software efficiently and systematically. Each phase — from requirement gathering to deployment — plays a vital role in ensuring that the final product meets user expectations.

With the rise of modern technologies, the role of DevOps in SDLC has become more crucial than ever. Automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment have made the process faster and more reliable.
